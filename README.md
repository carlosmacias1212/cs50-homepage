# My Project Description
I created a website showcasing some of history's most notable conquerors (Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, etc). Using HTML I added links to pages describing each conqueror. Users can also click a vote button (for each person) which causes the image of the conqueror to flash (javascript) and their vote count to increment by one. 

# What I Implemented
1. Used HTML/JavaScript to use event onmousedown to play audio for voting
2. Blink function in JavaScript to change visibility of images
3. CSS to style pages
4. HTML
5. JavaScript
